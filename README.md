# Local Qwen scene routing

Image Generation includes an optional **Smart Qwen Mode**. It expects a local OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint using a quantized `Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct` model.

Example with llama.cpp:

```powershell
llama-server.exe -m .\Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --ctx-size 2048 --threads 4 --n-gpu-layers 0
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions` in Smart Qwen settings. `--n-gpu-layers 0` keeps inference on CPU; use `--n-gpu-layers all` for GPU inference. The model only classifies RP text and selects batch-library metadata; it does not inspect generated images.

## NanoGPT inside ComfyUI

The repository includes a lightweight custom node at:

```text
comfyui_custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Megumin-NanoGPT
```

Copy that directory into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` and restart ComfyUI. Add **Megumin NanoGPT Text**, put `%ai_text%` in its `ai_text` widget, and connect its `text` output to the positive CLIP text encoder.

- `%prompt%` is the deterministic ready-to-render prompt.
- `%ai_text%` is an optional richer source package containing the RP scene and mandatory visual tags.
- Workflows without `%ai_text%` continue to work unchanged.

For safer key storage, set `NANOGPT_API_KEY` before starting ComfyUI instead of saving the key in workflow JSON.

**✨ New Features & Enhancements**
*   **Style Profile Library:** Transitioned from a single writing style configuration to a comprehensive Library. Users can now create, save, and manage multiple style profiles for different needs.
*   **Style Management:** Added quick-action buttons (**Regenerate, Edit, Delete**) to all style cards for faster workflow.
*   **Iterative AI Refinement:** Introduced a new 7th stage (Beta) designed for AI self-correction, allowing the model to identify and rectify its own systemic writing habits.
*   **Target Word Count Macro:** Added a new `[[count]]` macro in Stage 4 (Add-ons > Extra), allowing users to set specific maximum word counts for generated responses.
*   **Advanced CoT Framework:** Completely overhauled the Chain of Thought (`<think>`) logic in Stage 6 for improved reasoning and output quality.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Added full support for Japanese (日本語) within the Chain of Thought process.
*   **Output Language Optimization:** The engine now defaults to English if the "Language Output" field is left blank, effectively preventing CoT leakage into the final response.

**🛠️ Developer Tools & Safety**
*   **Global Dev Mode Toggle:** Introduced a global override switch. When enabled, saving or restoring a prompt override applies the change across all profiles (Characters, Groups, and Defaults) simultaneously.
*   **Prompt Safety Guard:** Implemented a fail-safe for the Global Dev Mode; `[[aiprompt]]` overrides are now restricted to local application to prevent the accidental erasure of unique style profiles.

**🐛 Bug Fixes & Optimizations**
*   **Group Chat Compatibility:** Resolved issues preventing the extension from detecting group chat environments.
*   **Stability Improvements:** Fixed a crash occurring when the "Generate Insights" button was triggered within the Style Editor during group chats.
**Under-the-Hood Preset Improvements**
Updated core prompting rules within `[[prompt3]]` to include:
*   Better introduction of new NPCs
*   Anti-passive voice enforcement
*   Enhanced living world dynamics
*   NPC agency prioritization
*   Scene continuation logic
